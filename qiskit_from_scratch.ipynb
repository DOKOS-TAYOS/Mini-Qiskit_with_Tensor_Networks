For example, if we select time and MPS, at each step we will have the MPS form for that time step, contracting each 'qudit' only with its corresponding operations. Additionally, we can add an eps that will tell us the maximum error allowed in the MPS compression of tntorch (only available for MPS with real numbers). If eps=0, then we do not approximate.
